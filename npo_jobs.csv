We are hoping for someone with long term availability, so ""fit"" is important.  She should be comfortable with whomever she lives with, happy, and know that she has someone available to help her when she needs it.

You're doing a great job. I know you need to hear that. Being away from your kids so much isn't always an easy thing. In fact, it's the hardest. But, I get you, Working Mom, because I am you.

The ""Mom Guilt"" you feel is real. I feel it, too. Do my kids know I love them? Do they see me enough? Am I giving them enough time and attention? Am I scarring them for life?

You're not alone, Working Mom. The workforce is full of women like you - strong, determined, hard working mamas set out to provide for their families and maybe even enjoy themselves along the way. I know you sometimes feel like you can't win. You feel like if you succeed at work, you fail at home. You feel like everything you do away from your kids outside of work becomes a choice between that thing and seeing your kids that day. You wish you had more ""me"" time than just the commute to and from your workplace. You long for more time with your kids while simultaneously wishing it was their bedtime so you can wash the dishes, pick up the toys, prepare for the next day and go to bed yourself. You are on the go from the time you wake up until the time you fall into bed. You wish days were 36 hours instead of 24.

I know that working isn't always a choice, Mama. For some of you it is - some of you know that being a SAHM is a calling you didn't receive and that working away from home actually makes you a better mom with no regrets. I respect that. Women should be allowed to have a career and a family. No shame in that at all, Mama. But, I also know many of you working moms did not choose to work but rather have to work. I know this makes it harder - you feel stuck. You wish for something different - for some way to pay your bills, see your kids, and be more content.

Join a network of over 9,000 educators  committed to creating a better future for the New York City students that need  them most. 
What  is The NYC Teaching Fellows Program? 
  The NYC Teaching Fellows is preparing a  critical mass of exceptional teachers committed to a better future for NYC  students. This means our teachers go where they're needed the most - they teach  in high-need communities; at schools with high populations of students with  disabilities or English language learners; and in the Bronx where schools  struggle to attract and retain quality educators. We know that when there are strong  leaders are in the classroom, all students - no matter their circumstances -  can achieve and succeed.
Fellows who successfully complete our  rigorous training program become full-time teachers within a few months of  enrolling. They participate in an innovative, practice-based summer training  program and then earn a subsidized master's degree in education while teaching  in a New York City public school. Fellows train to teach in subject areas  including math, science, special education, and bilingual education.  
Who We  Look For 
  There is no one profile of an ideal candidate. You may have built a successful career in business or  engineering and now wish to give back as a teacher. You could be a high-achieving recent graduate who majored in economics who now wants to share your passion for these subjects with NYC  students. Whatever your background, you believe that every student can achieve at a high-level and will do whatever it takes to help them get there.  We  look for candidates who:

Believe in social justice. You want to address  and rectify the inequalities plaguing students' communities.
Crave feedback. You strive to be the best you can be at any challenge you undertake.
Understand the  power of practice. You work deliberately to perfect new techniques.
Think on your feet. You can quickly devise solutions to unexpected challenges.
Want to work hard and have fun. You bring passion and joy to your work, inspiring  achievement and a real love of learning.

Somerville family with two boys (ages 5 and 7) seeking a responsible, fun, experienced sitter to provide regular after school help January to June, with continuing care through summers.

The job involves picking up the boys from school/daycare (both easy walking distance from our home), help with homework, arranging play dates, getting kids to afterschool activities, as well as some dinner prep, and light housework (empty the dishwasher, start a load of laundry).  Our kids love to play on the playground at the end of the block, enjoy sports, games, and arts and crafts.  Most time will be spent with the 7 year old (first grader), as the 5 year olds daycare is open till 6PM.  We've had regular evening sitters for several years and our boys love having a sitter in the house.

Regular school year hours needed starting in January:
Monday - Thursday 2:30 - 6:10
Every other Friday 2:30 - 5:00
1 Wednesday per month, school releases at 12PM.  On those days 12:00 - 6:10  

Summer hours needed:
Summer hours may vary because summer camp schedules vary.  The ideal candidate could potentially support both morning care (escort kids to camps that start ~9AM) as well as pick up at the end of the day (~4PM).  The school year is our first priority, so great sitters who cannot support summer should still respond.

Our current tutor/nanny is starting student teaching in the new year but is able to support us till January 11th.  Ideally, a new sitter is able to begin the week of January 14th.

Are you looking for a flexible part time job that connects you to the local schools?  Check out Coding with Kids - we are looking for instructors to teach coding to elementary and middle school students as well as camps.  We will provide paid training and get you ready to teach with another instructor.  We have opportunities at many local schools in the area!  We will train you on the curriculum so don't worry about that.  

What the job is like:
As an instructor, you teach after-school classes, evening classes and/or camps based on your schedule and availability. We provide the curriculum and even the computers.  Your focus would be to learn and teach the curriculum, build relationships with your students and their parents and most of all have fun.  Feel free to bring your thoughts and creative ideas to class - teaching the kids is so much fun, especially when they light up upon learning something new.

What's the commitment:
Each class is about an hour long, plus prep time and follow up.  After school classes are typically once a day so this is an ideal part time  job that still leaves you plenty of time for family social activities.  Once you are assigned to a class we need you to commit to the whole session - typically 6-8 weeks.

What you will get out of this job:
You will laugh every day.  The kids LOVE to code and they have fun.  Their enthusiasm is infectious.
You will learn coding - some classes are easier than others - you can decide what level you are comfortable with.
Competitive pay for training, prep time and instruction time.  
Connection to your community.

The kind of person we are looking for:
Although we will train you on the curriculum, you need to have a basic comfort with computers, logging in, accessing websites and connecting to wifi
Experience leading groups of kids.  You will undoubtedly use your ""Mom/Dad"" voice - they are kids after all.
Reliability - The kids depend on you to show up.
Sense of humor and flexibility.  
Comfortable speaking with parents, students and school staff. 
Transportation to teaching location.
